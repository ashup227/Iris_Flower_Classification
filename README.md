# Iris_Flower_Classification
Description:
The Iris Flower Classification project is a classic example of a supervised machine learning task aimed at categorizing iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements. This project uses a Logistic Regression model, a simple yet effective classification algorithm, to make predictions.

Problem Statement:
Iris flowers are commonly categorized into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. These species can be challenging to distinguish based on physical characteristics, such as the length and width of the sepal and petal. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify iris flowers into the correct species based on these measurements.

Dataset:
The Iris dataset, a well-known dataset in the machine learning community, is used for this project. It contains 150 iris flower samples, each with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. These features are used to train the Logistic Regression model.

Model:
Logistic Regression is a binary classification algorithm that can be extended to multi-class classification problems, such as this one. The Logistic Regression model will be trained on a subset of the Iris dataset to learn the patterns that differentiate the three iris species. Once trained, the model can predict the species of new iris flowers based on their measurements.

Project Steps:

1. Data Collection: Obtain the Iris dataset, which is readily available in many machine learning libraries.

2. Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data, which may involve handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding the target variable.

3. Data Splitting: Split the dataset into a training set and a testing set to assess the model's performance.

4. Model Training: Train a Logistic Regression model on the training data, using the sepal and petal measurements as features and the species as the target variable.

5. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data using appropriate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

6. Model Tuning: Fine-tune the model and hyperparameters to achieve the best classification results.

7. Model Deployment: Once the model performs satisfactorily, it can be deployed in real-world applications to classify iris flowers.
